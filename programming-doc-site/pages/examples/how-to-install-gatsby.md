title: How To Install Gatsby
---

Static site generators are awesome. Here is how to set up a static site with GatsbyJS.

The official Gatsby documentation is super easy to follow along with but here is a more in depth tutorial!

What I recommend is that you create a folder for all of your gatsby site builds to go into. So if you create a gatsby project today and then two months later you create another gatsby site they would both go into the same folder. This is completely optional but this is the system that I use.

In your terminal create a new folder using the ```mkdir``` command like this:

```
mkdir gatsby-sites
```
